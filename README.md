# Lua

This repository is dedicated to me for learning Lua.
This will include scripts made in lua and tests made in Lua for me to learn the syntax and the language itself.

## Running

To run any script here, will be necessary to have:

- `lua` installed, you can get on [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html)
